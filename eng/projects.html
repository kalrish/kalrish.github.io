		<h2><a href="https://github.com/kalrish/guardcheader">guardcheader</a></h2>
		<p class="projsubtitle">#include guards, automatised</p>
		<p>Even in small-sized C and C++ projects, it is often necessary to protect headers with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard">inclusion guards</a>. This program does that in a fancy way, including adding a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/preprocessor/line">#line directive</a> to make diagnostics refer to the original files.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://github.com/kalrish/json2lua">json2lua</a></h2>

		<p>Need to load JSON data from Lua code? No need for libraries! This program converts JSON files to Lua tables and it does that fast. Additionally, if your JSON data is static, you avoid having to ship it and parse it every time.</p>

			<li>DVI (and, in turn, using dvips, PostScript) and PDF output might be produced with LuaTeX using <a href="https://github.com/kalrish/mrp-tex">this system</a>.</li>
			<li>An e-book in EPUB format may be generated with code which is not yet developed to a degree that it can be made public.</li>
